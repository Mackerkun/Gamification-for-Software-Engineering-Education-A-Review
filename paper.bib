  abstract = {During the Coronavirus pandemic, e-learning systems have proven to be an essential pillar for education. This raises to surface what many studies have addressed earlier; creating a platform that completes the traditional classroom work and maximizes the effectiveness of learning outcomes. Striving to achieve such platform, studies have considered gamifying and personalizing the educational resources for the adaptation of educational systems as per the intended learners through intensive learning analytics. But was the learner really a part of the adaptation process taking place? Learning analytics are usually designed to the course's adaptation and solely for the teachers. Thus, learning analytics in gamified adaptive educational systems involving the course, teachers and learners together are still under investigation. In this study, the Personalized Adaptive Gamified E-learning (PAGE) model is introduced to extend MOOCs by providing new satisfactory levels of learning analytics and visualization in the rich e-learning process that supports the learner's intervention in the resultant learning analytics. The proposed Learning analytics have been developed to make the necessary adaptation to the course and learner's learning flow, as well as visualizing the process and adaptation decisions to the learners. Results show a positive potential towards learning adaptation and visualization, and a necessity to provide an additional focus for the gamification concept.},

  abstract = {There has been evidence that many of e-learning implementations fail to achieve their learning objectives due to incompatibility and lack of knowledge in developing an online information system. This failure could lead to frustration, confusion, and a decrease in the student engagement in learning. Moreover, transferring physical materials to the digital ones could result in boredom because there is no interactivity in the learning process. As a consequence, student engagement in learning decreases. Gamification concept may be used to increase student engagement in learning. This study develops an e-learning system by adding gamification concept. Gamification elements used in this study are leaderboard, activity point, experience point, badge, challenges, leveling, and add friends. The e-learning system is implemented in the Java Programming course. This e-learning is called Code Mania (CoMa). The e-learning is a web-based system that allows the user to interact easily. The e-learning also has an automatic evaluation feature to evaluate student work. The developed learning system is evaluated using whitebox testing that is path testing and blackbox testing. The result from the testing shows that the e-learning system could run well as specified in the system requirement.},

These small problems serve as assessments; the approach follows the assessment for learning paradigm in that assessments provide formative feedback to enhance the learning experience.

  abstract = {Video game development is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. The use of software product lines (SPLs) has proven to be effective in developing different types of software at a lower cost, in less time, and with higher quality. There are recent research efforts that propose to apply SPLs in the domain of video games. Video games present characteristics that differentiate their development from the development of classic software; for example, game developers perceive more difficulties than other non-game developers when reusing code. In this paper, we evaluate if the adoption of an SPL in game software engineering (GSE) can generate the same benefits as in classic software engineering (CSE) considering the case study of Kromaia. As in other disciplines dealing with human behaviour, empirical research allows for building a reliable knowledge base in software engineering. We present an experiment comparing two development approaches, Clone and Own (CaO) and an SPL in terms of correctness, efficiency, and satisfaction when subjects develop elements of a commercial video game. The results indicate that the elements developed using the SPL are more correct than those developed with CaO but do not indicate significant improvement in efficiency or satisfaction. Our findings suggest that SPLs in GSE may play a different role than the one they have played for decades in CSE. Specifically, SPLs can be relevant to generating new video game content or to balancing video game difficulty.},

  abstract = {Games are a popular form of entertainment and, due to their nature (i.e., interactive, immersive, etc.), strongly lend themselves for use beyond this original intent. Serious games, or games with a purpose, have been introduced to integrate the entertainment value games with domain specific objectives on important topics within education, health, and the environment to mention a few. In addition, gamification has been used to enhance nonentertainment applications with game elements; it aspires to foster behavioral changes, engagement, motivation, and participation in activities. In this context, the actions performed have meaning/value in the game experience in order to improve workplace performance or learn something in real life. The growing adoption of gameful experiences in all of the previous contexts make their design and development increasingly complex due to, for example, the number and variety of users, and their potential mission criticality. This complexity is nurtured, among the other factors, by a lack of theoretical grounding and adequate frameworks to engineer the intended solutions. In this paper, we report the outcomes of the 6th International Workshop on Games and Software Engineering: Engineering fun, inspiration, and motivation (GAS 2023 ) 1, which was held as part of the 44th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2022) in Pittsburgh, PA, USA on May 20, 2022. The workshop program includes two exciting keynotes discussing topics related to training and learning, and fulfilling the promise and potential of gamification. The two paper sessions examined gamification from the perspectives of software project, testing, and, design. The conclusion of the workshop is anchored by a panel of four highly qualified researchers and practitioners discussing lessons learned and the future of gamification.}

  abstract = {Contribution: Research has shown that computer science (CS) students who start programming assignments (PAs) early generally receive higher grades. This article presents and evaluates a gamification approach that utilizes software engineering tools to motivate CS students to start and finish PAs earlier. Background: CS can be difficult to learn because students often struggle with errors and how to properly test their code. For these reasons, it is essential that students start their PAs early. Furthermore, software engineering tools, such as version control and unit testing, are increasingly important for students to learn early in their career. Intended Outcomes: This gamification approach aims to motivate CS students to start and complete PAs earlier, as well as instill software engineering best practices. Application Design: To motivate students to start and finish assignments early, an open-source gamification system called the Leaderboard was developed. Using gamified points, the Leaderboard rewards students who pass PA unit tests well before the assignment is due. The system is fully automated using Github Classroom, a build server, and the Moodle learning management system. Findings: Results indicate students who used the Leaderboard did not start assignments significantly earlier; however, they finished assignments earlier, committed code more frequently, and passed more unit tests. The students found the Leaderboard to be motivating and passing unit tests was exciting for them.},

In particular, we demonstrate the use of gamification tailored to SysML v2 modelling.Each exercise is defined as a sequence of steps framed into notebook cells. On each cell submission, the POLYGLOT extension for.NET interactive runs several analyzers to gain insights of the student code before invoking the gamification engine, which checks if the gathered data fits the teacher-defined expectations. Interestingly, since cell contents are language independent and exercise evaluations are delegated to the gamification engine, this solution enables the creation of heterogeneous narratives, that is gamification scenarios mixing languages in the proposed exercises.},

Problem: There is a significant demand for empirical studies for the understanding of the impacts and efficacy of gamification. However, the lack of standard procedures and models for the evaluation of gamification is a challenge for the design, comparison, and report of results related to the assessment of gamification approaches and its effects. Goal: The goal of this study is to identify models and strategies for the evaluation of gamification reported in the literature. Method: To achieve this goal, we conducted a systematic mapping study to investigate strategies for the evaluation of gamification in the context of software engineering. We selected 100 primary studies on gamification in software engineering (from 2011 to 2020). We categorized the studies regarding the presence of evaluation procedures or models for the evaluation of gamification, the purpose of the evaluation, the criteria used, the type of data, instruments, and procedures for data analysis. Results: Our results show that 64 studies report procedures for the evaluation of gamification. However, only three studies actually propose evaluation models for gamification. We observed that the evaluation of gamification focuses on two aspects: the evaluation of the gamification strategy itself, related to the user experience and perceptions; and the evaluation of the outcomes and effects of gamification on its users and context. The most recurring criteria for the evaluation are "engagement", "performance", "satisfaction", and "motivation". Finally, the evaluation of gamification requires a mix of subjective and objective inputs, and qualitative and quantitative data analysis approaches. Depending of the focus of the evaluation (the strategy or the outcomes), there is a predominance of a type of data and analysis.},

  abstract = {Although testing software is paramount to safeguard our digitizing society, students are reluctant to consider a career in the field. A reason could be that dedicated courses on software testing are rare. However, even when such a course exists, students perceive testing as a boring, unrewarding and even dogmatic chore. For more than 10 years, we have been teaching a software testing course at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. Driven by our belief that an abundant exposure to software bugs makes good testers, we experimented with many ideas to engage students and make them love the topic. The most unorthodox, yet effective interventions we are proud of, were: (1) to scare students by analyzing past, software-related accidents, such as Therac-25 or Boeing 737-MAX; (2) to thrill them using bug-hunting gamification, enabled by the in-house developed VU-BugZoo; (3) to trust them an end-to-end testing of safety-critical software- intensive systems, such as model trains, automatic insulin pumps and even radiotherapy facilities, and (4) to inspire their career, by opening a dialog with test professionals from industry. The result is a mature course, read yearly by 50 computer science graduates, where almost 80\% of the participants find the topic interesting and challenging, and 40\% consider a future carrier in testing. These positive results make us confident that we found a formula that works. In this position paper, we would like to share our innovative ideas and lessons learned. Also in the future, we will stay committed to educate enthusiastic and responsible software testers.},

Having this in mind, we conducted a systematic mapping study of the negative effects of game design elements on education/learning systems. The study revealed 77 papers reporting undesired effects of game design elements. We found that badges, competitions, Ieaderboards, and points are the game design elements most often reported as causing negative effects. The most cited negative effects were lack of effect, lack of understanding, irrelevance, motivational issues, and worsened performance. The ethical issue of cheating was also often reported. As part of our results, we map the relations between game design elements and the negative effects that they may cause. Our mapping study can help gamification designers make more informed decisions when selecting game design elements to be included in education/learning systems, raising awareness on potential negative effects.},

This work aims to identify the concept of gamification and its applicability specifically geared towards Engineering courses. To achieve this goal, a bibliographic review was carried out in two stages. The first one looked for studies that addressed the definition of techniques based on games in general, their relation with the teaching process and possibilities of use in educational environments, whether virtual or not. In a second moment, the work listed several job prospects of gamification directed specifically to the Engineering context. For this purpose, several repositories were mapped and 38 scientific papers were selected. Through the mapping of the literature it was possible to obtain a knowledge base on the subject and, from this, to trace the potentialities not yet fully explored in which one can glimpse a field for the continuity of the research.},

Due to the relative infancy of this domain, three meta-analytical approaches were published in this domain, despite the accelerated speed of new manuscripts seeing light, indicating the need for more contributions in this regard. The present article explores this research area, concentrating on the relevance of publication bias tests in meta-analytical approaches, discussing the results of existing meta-analytical contributions in this sector. The heterogeneity of interpretation, analyzed constructs and relationships makes it, however, rather challenging to conduct a successful meta-analysis. The paper therefore deals with the comparison of existing methods for correction of publication bias, leading to an enhanced focus on evaluated constructs, and the effective exclusion of threats, such as population effect overestimation, selective reporting, and p-hacking.},

The proposed cycle consists of seven steps on which gamification theory and ABET criteria are combined. It arose from the adaptation of a gamification design framework, commonly used in industry, into the specific context of high quality education in engineering. It is formulated at high level. Consequently, it should be useful for practitioners having different requirements and expectations. A developed practice, following the proposed cycle, is presented, discussed and evaluated. In particular, the proposal is applied and exemplified, in a scenario for teaching introductory concepts of computer programming in a first-year course. A digital game was used within a gamified learning experience, as a teaching tool. However, the learning process does not rely solely on the use of the game by itself. Moreover, the devised scenario has a purpose beyond edutainment: contributing to achievement of student outcomes, under a continuous improvement approach, according to ABET. A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the developed practice was performed. A positive impact on students' emotional engagement and behavior was observed as a result of the evaluation process.},

For this, a systematic mapping that selected the most relevant studies on the use of quizzes in education was performed, aiming to clarify their relationships and mutual impacts. Our analysis shows that student engagement and quiz work is a prominent learning solution for increasing motivation in and out of the classroom. We found that quizzes can be applied in software engineering and through generic quizzes, online Quizzes, pop-Quizzes, gamified Quizzes, in quiz games or, alternatively, as an exercise in creating quizzes. However, we did not find approaches to the use of quizzes, explicitly containing Zimmerman's cyclic model, only some of the model's activities in isolation and not explicitly. We argue that sharing the quizzes will raise the potential for then to be use as a self-regulation tool in software engineering education. We describe the steps taken by a Software Engineering Gamification project to create a effective tool for creating and sharing software engineering quizzes. Our next requirement to be implemented in the project will be the application of self-regulation of learning containing the three phases of the Zimermman cyclic model.},

The paper outlines the results based on the experience of applying gamification of education to attract and stimulate student motivation and engagement in class. An approach for including games to teach software engineering methods and concepts is described. Different styles of software engineering games are examined and several of the most appropriate and relevant to the students' field of study are integrated in the Software engineering course. Descriptions of the games and the planned student progression through them are presented. A collaborative agile team-based approach is implemented and described. A suitable number of student groups have been selected, and the results from surveys held among those students are shown. Conclusions about the improvement of the process are discussed.},

This field of research is called gamification and represents the use of game elements (mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics) in a field (education, marketing etc.) that is not a computer game. A review of literature related to the field of teaching with online courses in information technology (e.g. programming, software engineering) shows that the topic of gamification has so far been inadequately explored, with the lack of theoretical and empirical research that would involve gamification methodology. Previous studies have shown that gamification can have a positive impact on the pedagogical and psychological aspects of e-learning. In this paper empirical research is presented regarding the use of gamification in online teaching of programming. A gamified e-course was designed for the lectures in programming, and a possible positive effect was examined on the usage of learning materials in an experimental group of students who will use a gamified e-course (online system).},

This is how gamification has been able to be applied inside of software engineering with the goal of increasing better results and the commitment of software developers. This is how gamification has been calling the attention in all academic fields as well as professional ones. It also has turned into a partially contradictory concept as it by itself faces a division in their underdeveloped theoretical foundations, academic value and delimited directives that are standardized for their independent application of their environment. The technology has been seen reflected in the actions that the human being develops by creating a system of social, cultural, and labor interrelations; therefore, education as a social event searches for the integral formation of the human beings, especially vulnerable groups such as incarcerated individuals who have been cast away from society for breaking some law or rule by means of been convicted to correctional facilities. They are relegated from activities useful to improve their life project and to be reinserted into society. In this paper we feature the development of a piece of multimedia didactic material for digital literacy, which is focused on the Ambato-Ecuador case study incarcerated individuals who mostly opt to take traditional workshops that are sometimes taken as distractors and not as endeavors for their reinsertion in the workforce. The research is based on an experimental methodology applied to a random sample to whom a pre-test was applied, and after the experiment insertion a post-test which is meant to identify the progress attained with the introduction of this didactic material through gamification techniques.},

Further exploration revealed that for each of the needs, there is a huge amount of research papers, thus validating the approach taken by this paper. First need is for blended learning. Old school approach where teacher instructs from a cathedra that worked for centuries should be replaced either completely or partially with online learning content, due to new natural media for learning - Internet. Second need is a gamification. Many research papers show that newer generations of students lose their attention and motivation for learning more quickly than previous, especially if the topic is difficult. To counteract this, many gamification efforts have been explored. Lastly, programming is difficult for students to learn, so new teaching techniques are always welcome to keep students motivated. With COVID 19 situation where live teaching becomes impossible and where many institutions were forced to migrate online, these needs became paramount very quickly. Based on said, this paper proposes a blended learning component that complements existing methods of online teaching and that also contains gamification elements. A way of transferring curriculum into actionable items of proposed system is defined, as well as a system itself. Authors hope that this approach will lead students to better understanding of programming topics, lower dropout rates and higher satisfaction in learning.},

During the last year ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art large language model has received even more attention both in the field of scientific research and in common use by individuals or companies. In this study, we investigate the possibility of adopting ChatGPT as a tool for designing gamification platforms in the Software Engineering domain. Leveraging the capabilities of ChatGPT, we assess how good is it at generating effective suggestions and ideas for designers or developers. To evaluate ChatGPT's potential as a gamification platform creator we narrowed the context to one particular Software Engineering activity, asking for possible aspects of the activity to be gamified. Each proposed aspect was subsequently unraveled by ChatGPT both asking in a shared and separate context, first following the conversational nature of the model, then applying a validated design framework. The study assesses ChatGPT's ability to select and integrate game elements to build a thriving gamification environment by framing the design of the platform to a state-of-the-art conceptual framework. To evaluate the goodness of the design choices made we relied both on the Octalysis framework and on personal experience. The findings of the papers show that ChatGPT can only create simple playful experiences not very effective. Although, by instructing the model with more specific desired mechanics and dynamics, it is possible to guide it toward the application of the ideas suggested. We argue that ChatGPT is not capable of building a gamified environment on its own, but it could still be used to build the foundation of a gamification platform as long as the designers refine and rough out the advice gained from a user-centered solution.},

Moreover, key findings include that gamification can serve as a strong motivational driver to developers to deal with software quality issues and also facilitate knowledge transfer, but also that sufficient effort needs to be put into balancing the reward system to achieve a long-lasting effect.},

  abstract = {Over the years, gamification gained consensus among researchers and practitioners as a tool to motivate people to perform activities deemed as tedious or unexciting. Hence, there exist many and heterogeneous application domains that may benefit from gamification. However, the domain expert and the designer are often separate individuals with dissimilar backgrounds, skills, and understanding. Thus, they need a shared language to communicate and to design a gamified system in line with its ultimate goal, the implementation of which can then be left to the developers. While several studies from the literature tackled the problem of formally defining a design language able to assist designers in the code production, they rarely foresee a framework capable to include all the involved stakeholders (e.g., domain experts). Moreover, it is essential to allow those stakeholders to monitor the gameplay at runtime and intervene when necessary, as the design process is intrinsically iterative. In this work, we present a design framework that models the whole life cycle of gamification solutions, from the design to the execution and monitoring of the system. Finally, we present a prototype of the framework implemented in the Education domain.},

  abstract = {While implementing gamification in software applications might seem easy, there are many questions and doubts about it when it comes to execution. Engineers always ask where to start, what elements should be used, and how they should work. Despite the public's belief, gamification is not only points, levels, and leaderboards. It can implement in software applications delicately and smoothly, even without being noticed, while providing fascinating results. Meaningful and reward-based gamification are two well-known types of gamification. Meaningful gamification considers the intrinsic motivation of users and has a better user engagement in the long run. This article proposes effective gamification: an innovative approach that implements both meaningful and reward-based gamification and describes the building blocks of gamification from foundation to the most sophisticated ones. We explained how effective gamification depends on user engagement methods such as utility, interactivity, social networking, and personalization and how engineers can implement appropriate gamification elements to build effective gamification from scratch. Moreover, this article describes the literature and the guideline materials that we have prepared for tutoring in the gamification workshop at WEEF-GEDC 2021 Madrid conference.},

It is said to be able to improve students understanding when the subject matters are taught in a less formal but more meaningful way. With the advances of technologies, educational games have evolved into digital games too. They have been introduced into many areas of study such as medicine and engineering. Software engineering is not spared. Since the last few decades, gamification through the use of digital and non-digital games are seen applied in the teaching of various topics of software engineering such as requirements engineering, design and testing. In this paper, a review is specifically made on the games that have been introduced to teach requirements engineering (RE) to the students. Particularly, the types, the learning objectives and the possible classification of the games are presented and discussed. The aim of the review is to identify the current state of RE games with respect to the above. Keyword searching was used to identify the relevant literature to be included in the review. Results showed that the existing RE games can be broadly divided into digital and non-digital games with role playing prevalently used as the game mechanics. Details on the learning objectives of the games and the evaluation performed on the games are also collected and analysed.},

Indeed many courses use graphs and other visualisations to aid students in grasping concepts quickly. Globally we are rapidly altering our teaching tools to suit the current blended or remote learning style due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. We propose a method that provides instant feedback showing how their programmed path finding algorithm works based upon games. The tool will provide feedback to the student about their code quality. Along with an element of gamification we aim to improve both initial understanding and further exploration into the algorithms taught. This tool aims to provide useful feedback to students in the absence of immediate laboratory support and gives students the flexibility to conduct laboratory worksheets outside of scheduled laboratory slots. Position: Software tools and teaching assistants heavily assist undergraduate students in learning how to program. In developing enhanced software tools, we can provide immediate feedback to learners. Thus, allowing them to gain an initial understanding of the algorithm before facilitated sessions. This further enriches their experience and learning during contact hours with teaching assistants.},

  abstract = {Abstract ICT tools in education are widely used to support the aim of achieving learning outcomes by improving critical areas such as student engagement, participation, and motivation. In this study, we examine literature to explore how game elements are used in capturing students' interest, which the study suggests is fundamental to the teaching and learning of Software Engineering in higher education. Given the potential of alternative ICT tools such as flipped classrooms to increase interest in learning activities, there is a gap in similar literature on capturing interest in gamified environments, which has the potential to improve the achievement of learning outcomes. We applied flow theory to provide a guiding frame for our study. Following a systematic literature review for our data, we analysed 15 papers from the initial 342 articles, which were extracted from IEEE Xplore and Science Direct databases. The main finding in the reviewed papers underscores the positive impact of gamified learning environments on capturing student interest when teaching and learning Software Engineering. While the reviewed papers were not conclusive in identifying the best game elements for capturing students' interest, we found, that game elements such as points and leaderboards were the most common mechanisms used to advance students' interest when studying Software Engineering courses. The findings also suggest that different game elements are used in gamified environments to increase participation and engagement. The paper adds voice to the practical implications of gamification for teaching and learning. Although our study requires empirical evidence to validate our claims, we believe it sets the stage for further discussion. In the future, comparative studies of game elements in similar environments will be beneficial for identifying the ones that are more engaging and assessing their long-term impacts.},

However, although all their promising benefits and rapidly developing, the gamification community should face a variety of theoretical, empirical, and technological challenges. Focusing on technological challenges, we can observe a need that claims for suitable gamification software tools that offer system-independence and flexibility, support the gamification design, implementation, and monitoring activities, and experiment with more game elements than only points, badges, and leaderboards. For that reason, this paper deals with the identified technological challenges by introducing a gamification software tool to cover the main lacks found. An analysis of the advances in gamification domain and their recent literature was conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the most popular gamification software tools in order to design and develop a flexible system-independent gamification software solution that goes beyond the implementation of the classic game elements. As a result, we created GoRace, a multi-context and narrative-based gamification suite that supports the entire gamification process, provides flexible and system-independent gamification solutions, and allows the creation of tailored and reusable gamification solutions that go beyond the classic game elements to immerse participants in a fun, engaging, and challenging narrative-based gamification experience.},

However, current teaching and evaluation methodologies are incorporating dynamic techniques that allow greater student participation in the learning process. It is essential that the classic model of education adapts to the changes in society and uses proper tools to encourage motivation in the education process. Gamification approaches generate motivation in the students and can lead to enhance the learning processes and outcomes. These strategies offer an alternative that is being used increasingly in higher education. Therefore, in this study, we developed a gamification strategy to generate motivation and engagement in engineering students. The strategy is applied in different courses and both in traditional and remote modalities. The validation of the proposal was carried out through a diagnostic tool in the form of a survey applied to the students of the courses where the gamified strategies were implemented. From these results we concluded that the gamified strategy helped to increase the motivation and engagement of the students, generating greater participation in the academic activities.},

  abstract = {This Research to Practice Full Paper presents that the gamification has been used to motivate and engage participants in software engineering education and training. The effects of gamification in this area have been studied and reported since 2011. However, there are no studies that propose standard procedures for evaluating gamification in the specific context of software engineering education and training. As a result, each study proposes their own evaluation procedures, making it difficult to compare approaches. The standardization of criteria, measures and indicators can allow an objective comparison between primary studies on gamification in software engineering, reinforcing results and revealing trends. Thus, the objective of this study is to propose and evaluate a framework for the evaluation of gamification in the context of software engineering education and training. The proposed framework focus on the structural aspect of an evaluation, consisting of concepts (entities) and their relationships. The development of this framework consisted of three steps: (1) the definition of the framework structure, based on the results of a systematic review of the literature on evaluation of gamification in software engineering education and practice, and its adequation to the GQIM (Goal-Question-Indicator-Metric) model; (2) an ad hoc review of this framework by three researchers; and (3) the execution of a PoC (Proof of Concept) evaluation, in order to perform an preliminar assessment of the framework adequacy. As a result, we were able to use the framework to model the evaluation of two primary studies, documenting the items found in these studies, which revealed the existence of a common measure between the two studies (Total lines of code, or LOC). The existence of only one common measure in both evaluations makes it difficult to compare the results of the studies. Additionally, we observed that one of the studies did not present information to justify the choice of the measures used in its evaluation and did not summarize all the data collected in its evaluation procedures. Therefore, the use of the framework might be useful to identify points of improvement for the validity of evaluation studies.},

  abstract = {Gamification, that is the use of gaming elements into non-game contexts, has gained a lot of interests in all those settings where the engagement of target users needs to be stimulated. Education and training have been historically struggling with keeping ``students'' motivated to pursue the completion of their learning paths. Lately these issues have been exacerbated by distance education: on the one hand, virtual participation to courses makes education far more accessible than requiring students to seat in the same classroom (and at the same time); on the other hand, the missing ``community building'' conveyed by physically attending the same course remarkably reduces students' engagement. In this respect, gamification has been applied as an engagement tool, e.g. in programming courses, by introducing challenges, awards, leader boards, and so forth, with the aim of motivating the students in keeping their efforts for completing their studies.In this paper we describe and compare our experiences in gamification solutions for programming and modelling. In particular, we distinguish some desirable features to have in gamification solutions for modelling courses, and illustrate our experiences in realizing them concretely. Our observations testify that while in principle many of the gamification elements coming from programming courses could be suitable also to engage students in modelling, there exist still remarkable obstacles in realizing them in practice.},

  abstract = {Students in vocational high schools majoring in software engineering programs are required to have web programming skills as one of the favourable demands in the industry today. However, there are lacking supports for learning such subjects in vocational high schools that can be offered from conventional methods. Hence, the students failed to understand and follow the instructions in the module. This study aims to develop a web application to comprehend web programming in an advanced way for students and engage them with gamification method. By combining ADDIE and Prototyping models the research obtained validation results 95.24\% and 91.93\% from education and media experts, respectively. Based on the small and large groups trials conducted at State Vocational High Schools 4 Malang, more than 87 per cent participants accepted the web application's feasibility. From these validations, it can be affirmed that the research product was valid and feasible to support the learning process of Basic Programming subjects in Vocational High School.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a case study of a gamified learning experience, designed with a guiding gamification framework, for a software engineering study group. The group was formed to evaluate the learning experience in a laboratory-like setting, and the results are intended to inform the design process. Grounded-theory procedures were used to analyze qualitative data about students' perceptions of the gamified experience. Students reported positive effects such as improved content comprehension, retention, and recap. They also highlighted a positive change in the study dynamics, especially due to the practical application of concepts, the game-like experience and a reduced amount of time for studying. The latter, however, was associated with a specific type of challenge proposed as part of the gamified structure. The other type of challenge, actually, made them face difficulties related to a lack of time. They also did not progress to higher levels of evolution proposed in the gamified structure. These are indicative of the need to improve the learning experience. These improvements, also discussed in this paper, will be evaluated in real settings in future work.},

It expresses a different approach to education that is mixing education with gaming, aiming to enhance the learning experience with game mechanics and rules and to provide stronger motivations for lifelong learning. Many works have illustrated the benefits of learning while playing. This work presents such a game-based approach that has been adopted and used in the development of an online multiplayer platform game, with a purpose to teach or train programming with JavaScript. In effect it is like what is usually called a serious game, or a game with a purpose. The game, jLegends, is online and available for everyone to train and test knowledge on programming and logic, within a role-playing gaming approach. jLegends is built with source-code scalability in mind, in order to be expandable or even become open-sourced in the future.},

  abstract = {The use of games and game elements in software engineering education is not new. In fact, their use in Software Engineering education is found in research papers since 1974, with a notorious increase after 2000. However, there is little information about the actual adoption of these approaches in software engineering education. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to investigate the use of games and game elements in software engineering education, in the perspective of educators. To achieve this goal, this study proposes and analyzes the results of a survey answered by 88 software engineering professors. We sample the participants by inviting 285 educators mined from one hundred well-stablished universities and educational institutions of different regions of Brazil. The goal of the survey is (i) to collect information about the use of games and gamification in classrooms and (ii) to understand the relation of ACM/IEEE knowledge areas and the used game-related methods. The results show that most of the professors are aware of these educational approaches, the games were adopted by only 21 participants and game elements were only adopted by 19 participants. Games are most used to cover ``Software Process'' and ``Project Management''. The most used game elements are Points, Quizzes, and Challenges. The results also show that the main reasons for not adopting the resources are the lack of knowledge, lack of information about relevant games for teaching software engineering, and the lack of time to plan and include these approaches in the classroom. Finally, results show a positive tendency towards the future adoption of these game-related approaches by the software engineering professors.},

Many students find learning about testing to be uninteresting and difficult to learn. This causes numerous students to develop inadequate testing habits, which can be detrimental to their professional careers. To encourage students to develop better testing habits, we used gamification to make the learning experience more engaging and enjoyable. In this paper we explore this idea by integrating gamification and statement coverage into a turn-based game called CoverBot. To test the effectiveness of CoverBot with respect to both teaching statement coverage and increasing engagement and enjoyment, we conducted a user study. We found that gamification makes the learning about statement coverage more engaging and enjoyable while also enhancing the participants performance and understanding of statement coverage.},

  abstract = {Soft skills are increasingly important to the engineering profession and course modifications are often needed to ensure students have opportunities to practice them prior to graduation. This suggests that engineering programs need to go beyond simply offering industry-based capstone courses and internships. Role-play has a long history as a tool for learning. It can be used to simulate real world practices in environments where consequences can be mitigated safely. This paper discusses the use of team role-play activities to simulate the experience of working in a professional, game development studio as a means of enhancing an advanced undergraduate game design course. In conjunction with the role-play, a gamification framework was used within the course to allow students to customize their course participation. Gamification was used to reward students for compliance with software process steps and for taking the initiative to improve their ``soft skills''. In this project allowing students to negotiate the nature of their activities and rewards helped them develop those skills. The student feedback obtained and the authors' own lessons learned are being used to plan the next iteration of this course.},

However, recent technologies have provided new opportunities for using games and their elements to enhance learning and student engagement. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we discuss how game related methods have been used in the context of software engineering education by means of a systematic mapping study. Second, we investigate how these game related methods support specific knowledge areas from software engineering. The systematic mapping study identified 106 primary studies describing the use of serious games, gamification and game development in software engineering education. Based on this mapping, we aimed to track the learning goals of each primary study to the knowledge areas defined in ACM/IEEE curricular recommendations. As a result, we observed that "Software Process", "Software Design" and "Profession Practice" are the most recurring knowledge areas explored by game related approaches in software engineering education. We also uncover possible research opportunities for game-related education methods.},

Software engineering is a young and promising discipline which is still under development and improvement. This is reflected when teaching software engineering in higher education. The aim of this study is to investigate the challenges and perspectives of software engineering education. To do so, a questionnaire study was conducted. 21 software engineering faculty and experts in teaching software engineering related courses participated in this study. The questionnaire contained demographic questions, questions related to students' engagement and to different methodologies adopted by respondents in the classroom. Results showed that the majority of respondents found engaging students in software engineering courses to be the biggest challenge they faced in the classroom. Almost half of the participants found difficulties designing practical activities for students. Results also revealed that the problem-based learning approach is the most used in software engineering lectures, followed by gamification techniques and role-playing which are new trends used to engage students. Moreover, the majority of the participants considered that the adoption of new teaching methodologies in the classroom produced high impact in the students' learning experience. Based on the outcomes of this questionnaire study, a conceptual model to engage students in software engineering courses is proposed. For future work, complementary studies should be implemented to evaluate the proposed model in a real-world scenarios including its effect on the achievement of learning outcomes.},

  abstract = {Code readability is one of the important software quality attributes that computer science students need to learn in their programming classes, unfortunately most of the students do not have the necessary work experience or background to appreciate the importance of code readability. Traditional methods of learning code readability tend to be less than interactive and practical in the classroom environment. With the advent of gamification technique, this study introduced a new interactive teaching method and implemented as GamiCRS, an online platform for students to learn code readability. The focus was on incorporating game-based mechanisms to enable students with positive attitudes towards a more interesting learning process. A complete incentive and reward model is proposed in the study together with a combination of both intrinsic and extrinsic motivators identified. To ensure its dynamic efficacy, a field experiment was carried out to compare GamiCRS with its non-gamified counterparts and to evaluate learning outcomes. The empirical results show a positive effect towards the application of GamiCRS in the classroom environment. As many learning activities in software engineering are typically challenging and seldom amusing, gamification can thus be applied as a compelling addition to supporting a wider variety of teaching tactics.},
